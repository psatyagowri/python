x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)
out:python is awesome

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)
out:python is awesome

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
out:5 jhon
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x+y)
out:error

x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  print("Python is " + x)

myfunc()
out:python is awesome

quiz:
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(type(x))

ans:list

without any whitespace:
txt = " Hello World "
x = txt.strip()

Convert the value of txt to upper case.
txt = "Hello World"
txt = txt.upper()
replacing:
txt = "Hello World"
txt = txt.replace("H","J")

Insert the correct syntax to add a placeholder for the age parameter.

age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and I am 
{}
"
print(txt.format(age))
